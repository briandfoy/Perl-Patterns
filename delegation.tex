\labeledchapter{Delegation}

    \section{Abstract}

Delegation sends the right message to the right objects at the right time
without forcing us to decide all of that.

    \section{Motivation}
    
Various things occur during the course of a program -- we might call those
things events.  Certain objects may wish to do various things if a certain
event occurs.  Furthermore, more than one object may want to do something
with the same event.  The Delegator may or may not know ahead of time which
objects will want to respond to a particular message.

    \section{Perl modules which implement delegation}
    
\begin{itemize}
\item Class::Delegate
\item Class::Delegation
\end{itemize}

    \section{Illustration of use}
    
Some example use of delegation.

    \section{How the design works behind the scenes}

This design does its magic by recognizing the event with one object.  That
object then sends messages to all of the interested objects.  Its like an 
object repeater.
