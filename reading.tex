    \labeledchapter{Recommended reading}
    
I was impressed with the recommended reading section of Extreme
Programming.  Many of the books related to a method of thought
or a worldview rather than directly discussing software engineering
or management.

    \section{Perl}
    
Whatever your experience with Perl, you can always learn more as
I am constantly reminded by the teach who show continual patience 
while they teach me Perl.

        \begin{itemize}
        \item
        Programming Perl
        \item
        Object-Oriented Programming in Perl
        \item
        Other Books
        \end{itemize}

        \section{Object oriented design and programming}
        
A lot of the examples that we show in most of the patterns use 
objects, although I caution you again that design patterns do
not mean object oriented programming, even though they make
implementation easy. Either way, if you need to know more about 
object oriented programming, check out these books.

        \section{Design patterns}
        
        Alexander's book
        
        Design Patterns
